- Xavier's Xhibitor is one of my school's magazine publishing sectors created by F14(2017 Mathematics Students of SXBC) where I have had the opportunity to work with Adobe Desktop Publishing tools and organized and managed fund raising operations. 
- Worked directly with other schools from Mannar and collaborated with  multi-disciplinary teams of students and teachers for bringing out creative ideas for the magazine and held meetings for the promotion of the magazine in those schools. 
- Interviewed personalities like politicians, religious leaders in Mannar regarding the magazine.
- Communicated with multi-disciplinary teams of vendors and politicians for fund-raising.
