- RD Labs is a start-up begun by my friend Randu Lanka who has given me a chance to
  work with them for some projects. Actually I’d learnt many aspects and got to know
  about IT & business. Mainly I focused on HTML and CSS. Later I felt like I couldn’t
  continue with them as I wanted to learn more different stacks and its technologies.
  So I quit within a short period. But expriences and advices which I got from Randu
  are priceless.
